The provided natural language premises describe factual statements about Tangent Online, an online magazine. However, the predicates and logical structure required to translate these statements into first-order logic (FOL) are not explicitly defined in the problem. The existing FOL predicates (e.g., Dependent, Drinks, Jokes, Unaware, Student) pertain to individuals and their attributes, while the premises about Tangent Online involve entities (a magazine) and its properties, which are not covered by the given predicates. Without additional or specific predicates related to magazines, their properties, or the relationships described in the premises, it is not possible to construct valid FOL formulas.
